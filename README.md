I build a simple model using candy-data.csv data set for predicting candy is chocolate or not based on its other features. This project is organised as follows: 

(a) extract featues from data set. 
(b) data preprocessing and split into train and test data for a given model. 
(C) hyper parameters tuning 
(d) basic SVM classification model 
(e) summary of model output.

candy-data.csv: data set for given model.
 
Result:
1. Auuracy: gaussian NB: 0.8846153846153846
2. Accuracy:Multinomial NB: 0.8461538461538461
3. Accuracy:Bernouli's NB: 0.8461538461538461
